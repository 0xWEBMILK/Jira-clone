# Jira-Clone Web Application (Back-End)

This is a back-end application designed for managing tasks and projects, similar to Jira. It allows users to create, update, delete, and read tasks, manage tags, users, and categories. The API is built with modern web technologies and offers a simple and clean architecture.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, update, delete, and view tasks.
- **Tag Management**: Add, update, delete, and list tags associated with tasks.
- **User Management**: Add, update, delete, and list users.
- **Category Management**: Create, update, delete, and list categories for tasks.
- **RESTful API**: Easy-to-use endpoints for interacting with the system.

## Future Plans

### Authentication
We plan to implement password authentication using JWT tokens to securely manage user sessions. This will involve:
- User registration with hashed passwords
- JWT token-based login and session management
- Secure access to specific resources (e.g., tasks, categories, etc.) based on user roles and permissions

## Technologies Used

- Main programming language: Python
- Main web-framework: FastAPI
- Main database: SQLite (or other)
- Main database framework: SQLAlchemy
- Swagger (for API documentation)
